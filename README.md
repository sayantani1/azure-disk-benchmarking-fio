# Benchmark Azure Disks

disk-benchmarking.py runs fio tests based on the .ini file provided for different combinations of bs and iodepth and outputs:
 - the combination of bs and iodepth that provides maximum IOPS
 - the combination of bs and iodepth that provides maximum throughput (MBps) 

The repo contains 3 ini files:
------------------------------

- fio-write.ini           - To test write throughput
- fio-read.ini            - To test read throughput
- fio-read-write.ini      - To test read, write throughput 

Update the directory parameter in the ini files to point to the directory to which the disk you are benchmarking is mounted.

Prerequisite:
-------------

Install fio

To execute the code, enter the following:
-----------------------------------------
python disk-benchmarking.py ini-file-name
  
Example:
--------

python disk-benchmarking.py fio-write.ini
